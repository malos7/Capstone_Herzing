# Capstone_Herzing

This was a capstone project done on Visual Studio for Herzing. This project is a game that allows players to fight a randomly generated enemy that scaled
in difficulty at the player leveled up. After each victory the player was allowed to choose an item that was randomly pulled from a database. The GUI displayed 
both the player and computers HP, DEF, ATK, SPD, and ENERGY. Players could choose between attack and defence on each turn and a direction to act in. This would prompt the 
enemy to do the same. The two choices would be matched like rock, paper, scissors to decide who took damage.
